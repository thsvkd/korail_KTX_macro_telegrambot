"""Pytest configuration and shared fixtures.

The package is installed (editable) into the environment, so there is no
sys.path juggling here - `import korail_bot...` just works.

tests/integration and tests/e2e talk to a real Redis, which testcontainers
starts for them and which therefore needs a Docker daemon. tests/unit does
not touch Redis at all, so a run restricted to that directory skips the
container entirely and needs no Docker.

The `storage` fixture below is the way to reach that Redis. A test that
builds its own RedisStorage owns closing it, and the check in
pytest_sessionfinish says so out loud when one is left open.
