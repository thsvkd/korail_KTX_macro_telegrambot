"""What every rail operator's search loop has in common.

Korail and SR are two companies with two APIs, but the thing this bot does to
them is one thing: ask for seats on a train that is sold out, over and over,
slowly enough not to look like a machine, and reserve the moment one appears.
That loop - how long to wait, when to re-authenticate, how to tell "sold out"
from "not answering", what to tell the user while it waits - has nothing to do
with which company is on the other end.

This module holds that part. What is left for a subclass is small and entirely
operator-specific: how to log in, how to ask for trains, how to reserve one,
and how to check whether a reservation has been paid for.
