"""
Who is on the other end of a Mini App request.

The chat flow never had to ask. Updates arrive over long polling from
Telegram's own servers, so the chat ID on an update is a fact - nothing a user
can write changes it. The Mini App inverts that: the page runs on the user's
phone and calls this app directly, so every request arrives with a chat ID the
sender chose. Believing it would let anyone book with anyone else's registered
account by typing a different number.

Telegram closes that hole with ``initData``: a query string it hands to the
page at launch, signed with a key derived from the bot token. Only Telegram
and this app know the token, so a valid signature is proof the payload came
from Telegram and names the user Telegram says it names. This module is the
only place that decides a request's chat ID, and it decides it from that
signature alone.
