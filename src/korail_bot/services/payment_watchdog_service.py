"""
Noticing that a payment happened, from the app rather than from a search.

The search process that takes a seat stays behind and watches it: it holds the
only logged-in session there is at that moment, so it can ask the railway
whether the reservation is still unpaid and tell the user the moment it is not.
That covers the ordinary booking and covers it well.

It leaves two holes, and both of them are silence exactly where the user is
waiting to hear something.

- **A random-seating run has no watcher at all.** It books a seat at a time and
  never gets to the watching part, so "payment complete" there still means the
  user said so.
- **A restart takes the watcher with it.** The search process is killed, its
  record is already gone (the callback cleared it when the seat was booked), so
  nothing resumes it. The reminders keep coming from Redis while the one thing
  that could stop them is dead.

This fills both from the app, which survives its own restarts and can log in
with the account the chat registered. It is deliberately the second choice: a
watcher already logged in beats one that has to log in again, so this only
takes what nobody else has claimed.
