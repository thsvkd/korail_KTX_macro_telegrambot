"""
Everything the Mini App can ask this bot to do.

The screen holds no Korail logic. It asks for stations and gets the list the
bot already fetches; it asks for trains and gets what ``rail_service`` found;
it presses start and the same ``start_booking`` the chat's confirmation button
presses runs. Nothing here reimplements a railway - each method is a
translation between JSON and a service that existed before this file did.

Two rules shape it. Credentials never travel outward: a registered password
goes into a login and never into a response. And the Mini App never gets a
route around a rule the chat obeys - the access gate, the trial allowance and
the duplicate-search guard are enforced by the shared code both call.
